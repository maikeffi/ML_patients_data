## Predict Future Medical Events

### Problem Statement

Insurance Plus++, a premium payer, wants to use predictive modeling on healthcare data to predict the occurrence of future events among their covered patients. 
They want to use existing data about their patientsâ€™ previous medical events to predict future events in their patient journey. 
Events are recorded in the standardized ICD-9 format (details here).
In this challenge, the goal is to predict the next 10 events in 2014 for each patient in order of occurrence.
